            Low on time - and ingredients? Takeaway isn't the answer. instead, grab just four key groceries and turn them into this amazing meal.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Red Pepper or Tomato Tapenade</li>
        <li>4 chicken breast fillets</li>
        <li>1kg Golden Delight potatoes, washed, peeled, coarsely grated (see note)</li>
        <li>Olive oil, for shallow-frying</li>
        <li>100g mixed salad leaves</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p  >
        Place the tapenade in a bowl. Add the chicken and turn to coat.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p  >
        Place the potato in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. 
        Add enough oil to a frying pan to come 5mm up the side. Heat 
        over medium heat. Add four 1/3-cup portions of potato and flatten 
        slightly. Cook for 2-3 minutes each side or until crisp and golden.
         Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel. Repeat, in 2 more batches, with the remaining mixture.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p  >
        Meanwhile, preheat grill on high. Cook chicken for 3-4 
        minutes each side or until cooked. Thickly slice
    </p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p  >
        Serve with potato cakes and salad.
